# DataStructureOptimisation
A personal project I'm developping, to test different types of data structure and algorithms and derive metrics to compare their efficiency!
I am implementing a data structures library from scratch, to have more control over internal operations than I would with the basic java structures.

## Data structures:
* Vector (equivalent to java's ArrayList)
* Binary search tree

## Algorithms:
### Vector sorting 
* Bubble sort 
* Mergesort
### Other Vector operations
* Inserting, removing elements.
### Binary search tree operations
* Searching
* Inserting, removing nodes

## Coming *soon*!

Hash tables, linked lists, and a library for comparing algorithms.
